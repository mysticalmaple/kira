"Kira" is a low-cost yet high-performance AI research and development workstation. (It's also an absolute BEAST of a gaming system.)
This repository will haven-be contain all the materials you need to build your own Kira workstation, including:

* Hardware & Buildout (with pictures! Possibly with videos!)
* Initial OS installation & configuration
* Software Stack
* Benchmarking & Evaluation

As Kira Mk.1 grows and matures, we will document the journey both here and on our blog,
which can be found at [kira.neroots.net](https://kira.neroots.net).
